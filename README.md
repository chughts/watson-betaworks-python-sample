# watson-betaworks-python-sample

This is a sample python application created by IBM Betaworks to 
show how a sample set of the Watson APIs can be used.

To run locally 
python manage.py runserver --settings=cognitive.settings.local

To run on bluemix
python manage.py runserver --settings=cognitive.settings.bluemix

On bluemix for the initial database set-up modify the manfiest to 
  command: bash ./runinitial.sh
you will need to modify runinitial.sh to your own db admin credentials  
for subsequent pushes revert to 
  command: bash ./run.sh

On bluemix the application needs the following services (edit the manifest.yml file to match the 
instance names for your environment

1. postgresql
2. personality insights
3. tradeoff analytics

If running outside of bluemix then the applicaiton needs access to service credentials. 
Put Service credentials into a file credentials.json in the Watson\static\ directory, in the form:
{
    "PI": 
	    {
	       "url":"https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/personality-insights/api",
	       "user":"<user - from bluemix services for personality insights>",
		   "password":"<password - from bluemix services for personality insights>"
	    },
    "TA": 
	    {
	       "url":"https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/tradeoff-analytics/api",
	       "user":"<user - from bluemix services for tradeoff analytics>",
		   "password":"<password - from bluemix services for tradeoff analytics>"
	    }
}
